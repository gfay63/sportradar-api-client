/**
 * Sportradar NBA API
 * Sportradar is the Official Data Provider of NBA statistics. We combine on-venue speed, detailed game and seasonal statistics, and advanced metrics for a full basketball experience. Every NBA game – including preseason – updates in real-time, with live event positional data.  The NBA API is consistent in structure, format, and behavior with our other League Specific APIs. Our primary feeds return schedules, standings, team/player data, and real-time scores.  Our other NBA feeds provide a host of complimentary statistics and information, including: * Rankings * League leaders * Game splits * Season splits * Injuries * Free agents * Draft information * Live advanced metrics * In-game substitution info * Live event positional data  Real-time customers are also offered five delivery Push Feeds to enhance speed.  The easiest way to get started with the API is to click the fork button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.  # Overview  1.  You need a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your free trial key by registering an account and creating an application from our [Developer Portal](https://developer.sportradar.com/). 2.  Once you have your sport specific key, replace the value `{Your API Key}` with your API key and click the save icon (or click the Meatballs Menu and select \"Save\") 3.  By default, responses to every request are sent in JSON. If you prefer XML, you can change the variable by clicking the \"Variables\" tab and replacing the Current Value for format to xml. 4.  Select an endpoint from the NBA v7 menu on the left, then click \"Send\" on the resulting screen. 5.  The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP response codes](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/Home#http-response-codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A 200 OK indicates all went well, while 4XX or 5XX response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively. 6.  Data for the requested endpoint is displayed in the Body section below.  # Other Resources  The [API Map](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/basketball/NBA_v7#nba-api-map) on our Developer Portal illustrates how to obtain the parameters you will need to access the API.  The [Statistics Summary](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/Sportradar_NBA_v7_Statistics_Summary.pdf) provides a high-level overview of all the data points provided within the whole API, giving you an “at a glance” view of the data we offer.  The [Documentation](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/Sportradar_NBA_v7_Statistics_Feeds.pdf) provides a list of endpoints for the API with basic descriptions. When applicable, we include information on the Coverage Levels provided for the API. This document also includes descriptions of each data point and information about where each data point can be found within the API.  The [NBA Play-In Tournament](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/Sportradar_NBA_Play_In_Tournament.pdf) provides a detailed breakdown on the structure and workflow of the Play-In Tournament in the NBA API.   [Frequently Asked Questions](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/basketball/NBA_v7#frequently-asked-questions) about the API can be found on the Developer Portal and in the Documentation mentioned above.  The [Change Log](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/NBA_API_v7_Change_Log.pdf) provides a list of changes and updates to this version of the API since the initial release of the API version.
