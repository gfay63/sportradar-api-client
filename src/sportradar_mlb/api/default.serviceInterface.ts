/**
 * Sportradar MLB API
 * Sportradar is the Official Provider of real-time MLB statistics. The data collection comes direct from the MLB operations teams on-venue. This provides lightning speed and the highest-quality stats available to power your baseball experiences. All MLB games – including Spring Training – feature full coverage.  The MLB API is consistent in structure, format, and behavior with our other League Specific APIs. Our primary feeds return schedules, standings, team/player data, and real-time scores.  Our other MLB feeds provide a host of complimentary statistics and information, including:  *   Injuries *   Pitch metrics *   League leaders *   Venues *   Depth charts *   Season statistics *   Seasonal splits       Real-time customers are also offered three delivery Push Feeds to enhance speed.  An extra package containing MLB Statcast data is also available. This package includes:  *   **Premium Deeper Pitch Data** featuring spin rate, vertical and horizontal movement and more specific pitch types *   **Premium Hit Data** including exit velocity, launch angle, spin rate and project home run distance *   **Premium Play Level Statcast** Data containing deeper information on fielding and base-running performance       The easiest way to get started with the API is to click the fork button to fork this collection to your own workspace and use Postman to send requests.  # Overview  1.  You need a valid API Key to send requests to the API endpoints. You can get your free trial key by registering an account and creating an application from our [Developer Portal](https://developer.sportradar.com/). 2.  Once you have your sport specific key, replace the value `{Your API Key}` with your API key and click the save icon (or click the Meatballs Menu and select \"Save\") 3.  By default, responses to every request are sent in JSON. If you prefer XML, you can change the variable by clicking the \"Variables\" tab and replacing the Current Value for format to xml. 4.  Select an endpoint from the MLB v7 menu on the left, then click \"Send\" on the resulting screen. 5.  The API calls will respond with appropriate [HTTP response codes](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/Home#http-response-codes) for all requests. Within Postman Client, when a response is received, the status code is highlighted and is accompanied by a help text that indicates the possible meaning of the response code. A 200 OK indicates all went well, while 4XX or 5XX response codes indicate an error from the requesting client or our API servers respectively. 6.  Data for the requested endpoint is displayed in the Body section below.       # Other Resources  The [API Map](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/baseball/MLB_v7#mlb-api-map) on our Developer Portal illustrates how to obtain the parameters you will need to access the API.  The [Statistics Summary](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/Sportradar_MLB_v7_Statistics_Summary.pdf) provides a high-level overview of all the data points provided within the whole API, giving you an “at a glance” view of the data we offer.  The [Documentation](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/Sportradar_MLB_v7_Statistics_Feeds.pdf) provides a list of endpoints for the API with basic descriptions. When applicable, we include information on the Coverage Levels provided for the API. This document also includes descriptions of each data point and information about where each data point can be found within the API.  [Frequently Asked Questions](https://developer.sportradar.com/docs/read/baseball/MLB_v7#frequently-asked-questions) about the API can be found on the Developer Portal and in the Documentation mentioned above.  The [Change Log](https://developer.sportradar.com/files/MLB_API_v7_Change_Log.pdf) provides a list of changes and updates to this version of the API since the initial release of the API version.
